# libgp4
Open-source alternative to Sony's gengp4.exe written in C#, rather than Delphi.

Made to avoid dealing with some of the more infuriating aspects of gengp4.exe that often end up breaking the .gp4 project file,
e.g. writing to the param.sfo and allegedly stripping any remaining symbols from executables (Unsure about the latter, someone confirm)
or building useless gp4's if the folder name isn't formatted "correctly" _(TITLEID-category1.00 == good, but TITLEID-1.00category == bad)._
